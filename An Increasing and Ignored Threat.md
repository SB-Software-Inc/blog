In 2022, in the United States alone, businesses of all sizes reported having experienced an average of 42 cyberattacks. These attacks led to yearly average losses of over $75 000, excluding stopped operations and lost contracts ([Guccione, 2022](https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/the-volume/)). With statistics as ridiculous as this, you would expect the average business owner to take the necessary precautions. Unfortunately, over half of the USA's businesses' IT teams do not have any budget for basic cybersecurity implementation ([Guccione, 2022](https://www.cyberdefensemagazine.com/the-volume/)).

Although cybersecurity is not a new problem _per se_, it is a very quickly growing threat. As systems become more complex, the number of discovered and registered common vulnerabilities or exposures (CVEs) grows exponentially. Since these vulnerabilities are publicized, they are fairly easy to assess and detect given that the proper tests are done. Unfortunately, as the numbers clearly show, it is not a priority for most. Only 14% of remote or soon-to-be remote companies consider cybersecurity to be a priority in the United States ([Muncaster, 2022](https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/security-overlooked-in-rush-to/)).

According to the World Economic Forum, cybersecurity is the 7th biggest threat to society ([OMDIA, 2022](https://omdia.tech.informa.com/)) yet isn't a priority in the eyes of most people. Some would say that prevention measures are too expensive and that they'd rather take a risk instead of investing such large sums. For most small businesses this is understandable. Thankfully, we at **[SB Software Inc.](https://sbsoftware.ca)** offer **affordable** and **quick** solutions to an unavoidable issue, which will, as per the aforementioned numbers, save you a fortune in the long run.
